# Privacy Policy
Below you will find all information about the processing of your personal data by the eXpence app from David Lin (hereinafter referred to as ‘eXpence’ or ‘we’) and your data protection rights.

**eXpence takes the protection of your personal information very seriously. Therefore, we generally do not collect any personal data and only limit ourselves to data that is absolutely necessary for the operation of the app.**

In principle, no personal data such as name, age, marital status, date of birth, address, telephone number or email of the respective user are collected. In order to use MoneyStats in its basic functions, no such personal data is necessary and no login or registration is required.

eXpence only allows you to record your expenses and store them in this application. You can decide for yourself how detailed your entries are in this application. eXpence offers you input masks to make this possible and to manage, evaluate and illustrate the data. By default, the data is only saved on your device, i.e. where the application was installed. All the data you enter will be stored in a protected area on your device that cannot legally be viewed by third parties.
<> Optionally, you can set up additional access barriers to this application (e.g. PIN protection, Touch ID, Face ID).

As soon as you purchase a paid additional service in eXpence, non-personal data will be stored. However, the Apple App Store manages all transactions and issues the invoices. eXpence only learns that a purchase or cancellation has taken place, but does not receive any personal information such as the invoice, the address or the buyer.

If you continue to take out a paid subscription, eXpence will receive further anonymized payment information such as the term and expiry date, which are absolutely necessary for the additional service. This anonymous data is also shared with our partner ‘RevenueCat’, who is responsible for managing the subscriptions. Your purchase history may also be evaluated to check whether your subscription is still valid, expired or canceled.
